In February, I have definitely shifted back to building on-the side and spending **most of my time freelancing**. This will bring some financial stability and, as things start to get a bit easier with the baby, I think I can still dedicate some of my time growing my following and building features and new products.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

I really wanted to write a new article this month, but I didn't find the time. I hope to write 2 articles in March instead. People keep subscribing, I have now **27 members, which is 8 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

No newsletter sent this month. But I improved the website a bit, now it has a slightly better look and the DB is more stable. There are still some hiccups in the job fetching mechanism. My plan is to solve them next, and then launch again on ProductHunt, trying to sell the project.

I added less than **10 subscribers in February, with the total slightly above 2060 now**.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I have done a few improvements on the website, mostly usability and UX stuff, no new fancy feature.
My main problem is that people subscribe, but they don't use the product. They don't even connect their Threads account, which doesn't make any sense.

I have got to **contact these potential customers** and understand what is holding them back.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Lots of work on it. I keep improving automation and publishing articles on the blog and on Telegram. I renewed the domain for another year, and now I have got to commit to it.
I wonder why, after many months of constantly pushing new articles, with high ranking keywords, my traffic from SEO is still very low. Less than 500 impressions and only 3 clicks in the last month. I published one new video and one new short on YT. Still low numbers, but I'm getting better and faster at making videos at least.

I have got now **33 subscribers on my YT channel** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 47**. I will make a small celebration when I get to 50.

## [Freelancing][personal]

I have started to collaborate with a friend this month. Hopefully it will be a fruitful and long collaboration, it's going very well so far. I've also taken an interesting horse betting gig that I found on Upwork, that was good to keep my profile alive and a new 5-star review.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $144.59      |
| Domain renewals   | - $1024        |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $6.60        |
| X Premium         | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace       | - $0.77        |
| DeepSeek          | - $5.00        |
| Total             | + $107.39      |

Book **sales are in line with 2024**, which is a bad news because in the last months they have been increasing on average. Nothing new on the expenses side, and I am asking myself if I really should spend more now that I am making some money with freelancing. I could **maybe spend on advertising** to try to grow some of my side projects.
