Another month another report. Looking at my notes, it seems such a long time ago. I guess that means I am making progress, or at least I am moving forward and doing things. Which is positive.

I started to meet new people again in June, which is something I didn't do since a very long time. Living in another country is complicated to find new people, but social media help. Despite all the hate and brainrot online, I still think socials are a net positive in people's lives. Especially people that travel a lot and have non-standard interests.

Work-wise, I kept freelancing, this helps me have a stable income. Although I am not saving, and actually losing a few hundreds each month. Life is expensive in Moscow, and the exchange rate is not making it easier.

Time is still an issue, but getting better. I manage to find time to build on the side, especially at night and sometimes on weekends. I got into a routine where around 9 pm everybody is asleep, and I can build for 2-3 hours. I think that's what Pat Walls does. Focused work for 2 hours every day is enough to build a business.

But I feel like I'm a bit rusty and cannot ship as fast as before. That's why in June I decided to challenge myself. I am going to ship 3 products by the end of the Summer. Ideally one each month. Let's see if I can make it. The goal is to build some ship muscle, not to launch a big success. Low expectations.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

I didn't write any article this month. Too busy building. But I am going to start writing a write-up of my freelancing activities with full breakdown of revenue there. If you are interested just [follow the TG channel][tg-datafreelance].

Somehow subscribers keep increasing. There are now **65 members, which is 8 more** than last month. Maybe I can get top 100 before the SUmmer ends.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

No activity this month. I had a chat with [Fran Betteo][] on X the other day. Gave me some motivation, maybe with a bit of hustle I can get a few hundred bucks. Very inspiring story.

Subscribers were stable in **June at a total of 2030**.

## [xTopics][xtopics]

I launched a Product Hunt trend tracker! It's called The initial idea was to launch it quickly on Product Hunt in order to do some product marketing for xTopics. As I kept working on it, I started to see more potential, and I plan to integrate the feature inside the main product. The screenshots I posted online attracted some attention, and I might even think of pivoting out from Threads.

The reason I am thinking of leaving the Threads' audience is that **I get almost no traffic from that platform**. Instead, I get much more visits from X. Even if I make more impressions with my posts on Threads. For example, an interesting thing happened this week. I saw a **post on X by Gumroad, they were looking for ideas and were ready to pay** people. I replied [plugging my product][xtopics-plug] and **this got ~100 clicks and something around 8 new free subscribers** to the tool. Looks like the landing page is converting after all. But of these 8 subscribers nobody connected their Threads account. Probably they don't have a Threads account, after all they come from X. But it would be stupid to ignore this strong signal. So I wonder what to do.

1.  Maybe I am targeting the wrong audience. **Maybe I should target the X audience** and make a tool for them (but I will need to pay for the X API).
2.  Maybe **I need to broaden my scope** and make a tool that shows trending topics across various platforms (like Product Hunt, HackerNews and GitHub).
3.  Maybe I should **try this marketing strategy on Threads** as well and stick to the original idea.

I think the less effort path is number 3. **I need to find a few keywords and accounts to target** and start commenting on their posts daily. Sounds like a good marketing effort. Let's see if it pays off this month.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

The season is over and **in May I published my last prediction** before the football starts again in 2 months. I didn't make any new video.

There is more football this Summer with the Club World Cup starting in June. Would be interesting to write something about that, maybe a video, maybe an article analyzing the various teams. It **sounds like a lot of effort** though, between getting the data and trying to get some sense out of it. Probably better to focus on something else.

I have got now **40 subscribers on my YT channel, unchanged from last month** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 71, only 3 more than last month**. I am now relying only on word of mouth to acquire new subscribers, since my Reddit ban.

## [Freelancing][personal]

I kept freelancing in May, **lost one client, but found another one**. Here I am not going to post the earnings, but enough to say that they range between 2.5k and 4k a month, depending on what I do. And I am doing very interesting work, and although I am not saving anything, it helps me and my family pay the bills.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month (without freelancing).

| Item                 | Income/Expense |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales    | + $113.38      |
| Appliku              | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner              | - $6.97        |
| X Premium            | - $11.15       |
| HuggingFace          | - $0.67        |
| Freelancing services | - $13.71       |
| **Total**            | **+$70.88**    |

Going back to positive territory again, after the big drop in book sales that happened last month. But **I should think like a startup and invest every bit of profit from my projects back into the business**. There are a few things that come to mind

1. Turn on **Amazon ads** for my soccer betting books.
2. Pay for X API and **expand xTopics in the X/Twitter niche**.
3. Pay for a **service that lets me send hundreds of cold emails** to potential B2B leads.
4. Pay for an AI API to **build an AI first product** (probably something around image generation for B2B).

This month **I will try Amazon Ads**. I have already done it before, but it didn't really work well, and I spent more money than I earned in the end. But I got in touch with [Alexandra][alexandra-x] this month, she was super-kind to give me some pointers on which keywords to target, and I am going to give it another shot, since there is also Prime Day and in general **book sales go up for me in the Summer**. By the way, follow [Alexandra][alexandra-x], very interesting person and great content both on X ad YT.

## The future

Re-reading this update, **I think I am doing too many things at once**. I am definitely trying the strategy of throwing spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, but I am sticking with spagetti projects that don't work for too long. Spending time on things that don't work is not a good idea, but I also **have a hard time letting go and understanding what is not worth my time anymore**. Maybe I will give one full month of attention to each of my projects and if it doesn't get traction I kill it? Sounds like a good strategy to move faster.
