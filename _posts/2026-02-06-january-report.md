Finally, a write-up that appears in the first week of the month.

In January, I spent most of my time **writing and launching the first book of the year**. This is a short book, not like [Quantum Physics for Beginners][book-link]. And it's aimed at selling around a specific holiday in February. And it's not Valentine's Day. Can't say much more about it. But it's definitely an experiment that, so far, is going quite well.

I kept freelancing, but not more than 2 days per week. Will I look for other freelancing opportunities? Let's say not in the next couple of months.

I kept spending on ads for [the Quantum Physics book][book-link] in January too, but with a reduced budget. Around the beginning of January I managed to reach was around 52k, which corresponds to 4 or 5 sales per day. And I also managed to **keep the best-selling badge** in a few categories for the e-book version. I think keeping the price of the e-book very low contributed to getting the badge, which is definitely helping the sales of the paperback too. I also pushed up the price a couple of times, and now I am not far from my competitors price tag, but there is still margin to go higher. I think I was slightly profitable on the book this month, or around break-even. To push sales, **I need to market the book outside of Amazon ads. Which means TikTok.**

For the second book **I learnt from my mistakes** and I published the e-book first, got more reviews than my direct competitor and then published the second book. The sales started slowly, but now they are picking up, and I have reached **a healthy 100k BSR**. The peak of the sales should happen next week. Let's see how much I can sell. So far I have sold 20 copies, of which 10 paperback. I need to get to 50 paperback copies to break even and from there it will be all profit.

## The cashflow

Time to look at how much money I lost this month (without freelancing).

| Item                      | Income/Expense                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon book sales         | + $359.71                                       |
| Book Ads                  | - $327.47                                       |
| Appliku                   | - $10.00                                        |
| Hetzner                   | - $6.65                                         |
| X Premium                 | - $8.72                                         |
| Grammarly                 | - $14.00                                        |
| Ideogram                  | - $25.00                                        |
| Book cover                | - $50.00                                        |
| Other publishing services | - $30.00                                        |
| **Total**                 | <span style="color: red;"> **-$112.13** </span> |

Again **in the red**. This time is not as awful as last month, but still. My plan is to **keep publishing one book each month**, and there will be costs associated with it. So to make this work, I need to improve the profitability of the books I already published over time. Eventually I hope to publish a huge book, that will be selling 1000 copies per month, but until then, I have got to keep the costs low. For the next book, I plan to design the cover myself. I don't think I can do it for every single book I publish. Other costs are difficult to keep low, so I will probably slightly increase the price of the books to balance the sheets.
