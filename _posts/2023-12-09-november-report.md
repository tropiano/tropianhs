My focus in **November** was almost exclusively on freelancing. Now I have 2 big clients taking most of my time, and I am not working a lot on Data Internships. SEO should help however, and as long as I keep posting new jobs and publishing new pages, my rankings should be improving and traffic should slowly but steadily grow.

November was also Black Friday and I have been lucky enough for my books to be featured in a couple of lists. It is great to see how much a good marketing channel can do. In November, I got 479 visitors to my Gumroad page and 68 sales. A whopping **14% conversion rate**, almost triple my usual conversion rate.

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $91.50       |
| Gumroad book sales | + $333.09      |
| Freelancing        | + $8042        |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $5.31        |
| brev.dev           | - $5.68        |
| Total              | + $8445.60     |

As expected the book sales picked up quite a bit due to **Black Friday**. I noticed a slight decrease in Amazon sales, but more than made up by the sales on Gumroad.

Freelancing is now my main source of income, and I am sharing everything I learn in the process. Funny enough, I tried to start freelancing in 2017 already, but it didn't work out. At that time I was moving **from London to Italy** and I didn't know yet if I could keep my job remotely. Before 2020, it was not very common, and I was worried that it would not work out for me. So I started to look around, build a portfolio, and send 4 or 5 proposals on Upwork. My wife even printed me some business cards to advertise my services in some London meetups. In the end, I kept my job and started to work remotely from Italy, for another 6 years.

At the time, I didn't try freelancing seriously, because I didn't need it. But if I told my old self of 2017 that after 5 months freelancing I would be making almost $10k per month, he would be very pleased. My 2023 self is impressed too, but I am already **looking forward** and trying to find out what could be next. Don't get me wrong, freelancing is fun, I learn a lot, I have the chance to work on great projects, I earn good money and I can share all the things I learn, but I am always looking for something different, and I have this feeling that I could be doing **something more, something bigger**, and I don't have the time or the energy for it. If I freelance for almost 5 days a week, I cannot have time for my side projects, or just to think and be stricken by inspiration. Something to think about.

I should also **write** more often. One of my [blog posts][blog-post] went semi-viral on Reddit this month and as a result, I got almost **200 followers on Twitter** and a huge traffic spike on my website and [Data Internships][data-internships]. I experience it again and again, putting yourself out there, sharing what you do, your learnings, your mistakes and wins, is always a good idea. There is always a **big upside** to it, and I can't think of any downside.
