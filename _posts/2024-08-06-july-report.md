This month I split myself. In the first part, I focused on **marketing my Euro 2024 book**. In the second part, I **experimented with a few ideas**, which will lead me to launch a new product in August and almost certainly another one in September.

## [Euro 2024 book][euro2024]

I followed an **established strategy for marketing** the book. On each match day, I posted my models' predictions on Reddit and created an updated visualization of the teams still in the Tournament. I **got banned** from r/soccerbetting but I kept posting on r/sportsbook and r/euro2024. I also posted the visualization on r/dataisbeautiful, where I got a lot of attention (the most popular post got 1.8M views) but I don't think I got many sales from it.

Reddit was a **huge source of traffic** for the whole month of June and the first half of July, but it dried out pretty quickly once I stopped posting after the Euro 2024. It was an interesting experiment though, I will keep posting there once the European football starts again around the end of August.

The **Amazon KDP ads** were a bit underwhelming. I only got 1 sale out of them and I spent more than $100 and got one sale (less than $10) back from it. Not worth it, or I am doing something very wrong.

Putting together all the sales from Gumroad and Amazon, I have sold **85 copies** of the book, which is not the 100 target I set for myself, but it's not too far from it. I feel like **I have only half failed** here. Moreover, people are still buying the book, even after the Tournament, so it might reach 100 copies sold, at some point this year, after all.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

My mailing list has now **more than 1500 subscribers**, many of them from other newsletters' recommendations. I sent 3 newsletters in July, but the new subscribers do not seem as engaged as the historical ones. The **Open rate dropped** from 55% to 27% and the **Click Rate dropped** from an average of 7% to an average of 2% now. I am not complaining, since those are still good numbers, given the volume of subscribers. However, I plan to **clean up** the list in the next weeks to avoid sending emails to subscribers who are not interested in receiving them.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

This has seen some progress in the last couple of weeks. Given that I have been more active on social media lately, I have had the experience of going **viral on X and Threads 2 or 3 times**. This has sparked the idea of marketing X Topics as a viral tool, given it helped me write viral posts on both platforms.

Moreover, **Threads released its API** in June, and it feels like it's a great opportunity to start an analytics tool for the platform. Luca and Mattia jumped also very fast on it with their [BlackTwist][blacktwist], and are doing a great job.

With X Topics I want to create something similar but with a different angle, using AI to **generate insights** on the right topics to talk about. This was very difficult to do with X, where the API is impossibly expensive. But on Threads, **the API is free**, and I think people are sleeping on it. I am fixing the latest bugs right now, already opened the app to a few Beta testers, and I am launching in the next few days.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $238.83      |
| Gumroad book sales | + $61.93       |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $5.31        |
| Twitter blue       | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace        | - $2.04        |
| KDP Ads            | - $56.70       |
| Total              | + $216.03      |

Drop in revenue of almost $100, mainly due to the drop in book sales on Gumroad. I **need to add a few more small bets** and revenue streams to the collection above, as I have been struggling to generate any revenue other than books for the past 5 months now. Soon I will not have that much time anymore, and I will need to go back to freelancing. Hopefully, I have **a few more months of runway** ahead of me before needing to start to look for a job.

## Going viral

As I mentioned before, **I went viral again**. This time it was with a much shorter post, still about Italy, and it touched more nerves than last time. It got again, almost 2M impressions on X, more than 100k impressions on Threads, and I got a few angry messages, people straight up insulting me and **calling me a failure**. But I realized, not only I don't care about it. Quite the opposite, it kind of **fuels me** and gives me some kind of energy and motivation to work harder and better.
