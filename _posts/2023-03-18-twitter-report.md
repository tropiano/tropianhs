### Twitter Report

In October I saw an Upwork proposal about a dashboard for Twitter.

The client wanted to have a view of followers, engagement, likes, and tweets for a set of clients he managed. Probably it was an agency that managed different clients and wanted to track the performance of their accounts during a marketing campaign, or something similar.

I built a [little dashboard][tw-report] in Django using Twitter API (it was still free back then). Then I used that dashboard link to land one of my first freelancing contracts on Upwork.

I check it from time to time and it still works, every day it updates the stats of the 4 test accounts I used to test it. It is pretty great nothing broke so far.

Today I have just added a small feature. Feels good to code on a product again.
