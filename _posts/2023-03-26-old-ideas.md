I am going to leave my job soon. In 3 weeks and then I will be by myself and in another country.

Half excited half scared but I think it's a good thing and I should have done earlier.

I have an entire Trello board full of business ideas to try. I will go through all of them until I find one that works.

Exciting times are ahead.
