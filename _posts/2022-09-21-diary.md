### 11 October 2022 - On Render, Digital Ocean and slow sales

I finally managed to deploy the Twitter Report App. I spent the last 3 days trying to do it.

Heroku would be the best solutiom BUT they are going to increase their prices like crazy soon. I tried Render and it doesn't work for me. Easy to deploy the Django app, but then I cannot create the admin user because I cannot access their console without paying. Useless.

I ended up using Digital Ocean. Paid 5 $ for a Droplet and that's it. You get a machine you can ssh into and there are nice tutorials on how to configure a Djangok app. I configured Gunicorn, Nginx, had 100 issues, but thanks to StackOverflow I was able to solve them all. I added some data to the DB and it can even serve static files! [Watch here][http://67.205.133.61/users/]

Cool, so the next step is to showcase this and other projects, cross my fingers and start to look for freelancing jobs on Upwork.

Slow or Zero progress on the other projects. Still have not heard from the advertisement opportunity at 150 GBP for 3 months. Will probably go for the other one (it is so expensive though, will try to negotiate). The book has only sold 3 copies on KDP. October revenue estimated to be around 50 €.

Nothing worth it on MicroAcquire. Too many ecommerces at my price point.

### 5 October 2022 - On CTR and future opportunities

These last days I looked for some more opportunity to advertise my book. I now have 2 offers

- 150 GBP for 3 months on a website with 14k visits per month (estimated)
- 200 GBP per month on a website with 15-20k visits per month (verified)

The first offer is clearly better and I could run it until the World Cup, when I expect the website to get a traffic boost, it always happens during the World Cup. But the second offer seems more professional, the guy replied to my emails very quickly and I am more certain that the relationship will be smooth once I place the ad. Will have to decide before the end of the week.

I looked for some advice on IH about this ad thing and I found a nice post on newsletter ads, with a framewrok I could use to manage my expectations. The Click Through Rate (CTR) on an ad is usually below 1%, let's say 0.5%. Once the user gets to my page it will convert more or less at the average conversion rate I get on Gumroad (which is around 5%). So, from 15k users, 75 will see my Gumroad page, and 3 or 4 of them will purchase. Which means something around 60 to 80 USD per month. Probably not worth it but I am leaning towards trying it anyway. Maybe the audience will be extremely targeted and I will get a higher conversion than average.

I made some progress on the Twitter Report app. Added a scheduler to query the Twitter API, integrated the chartJS and now it's almost ready. Will write the last page tomorrow and then will look for ways to deploy it. Hope to publish it in my portfolio on Upwork soon. I should start applying to Upwork jobs, I am really surious how much money (if at all) can I make in 1 month on the platform.

Kept my eyes on MicroAquire, still looking for a B2B around 10k ARR, but couldn't find anything that suits me. I will keep looking, I feel like I could find some great opportunity soon.

### 2 October 2022 - On Ads, Django and Moscow

Long time since the latest blog. Travelled a lot and discarded it unfortunately.

Some days ago I heard back from one of the tipsters websites. I planned to advertise my book on their newsletter. Turns out they do not run a newsletter, but I could place an ad on their website. Their quote is interesting and I think they have a large traffic (they rank pretty high on Google). I have asked them for a proof of traffic in August. As soon as I have it I will decide what to do, probably will run an ad for 1 month and see how it goes. For this reason, I spent some time designing a banner for the ad, it doesn't look horrible and it took me just a little time to do. Probably not worth making something professional and spending money on it, given I don't know how much it will convert. Once it's live and I have an idea of the conversion rate, I will see if it is worth it, and ask for a professional.

One of my book readers asked me for some advice on the application of the model with more advanced statistics. I do not have the time to go about this so I told him I would be able to do some consulting on it. Didn't go well, but I think it was the right move. Maybe one day I will be able to do some consulting.

Made some progress on the Twitter report tool, almost ready with a Django website for it. Probably will be ready by the end of the week, when I will try to put it live somewhere (render.com maybe?). Once it's live I will have something to show in my portfolio for Upwork.

I am in Moscow to visit family now. Quite difficult to work from here, but with VPNs and deleting cookies regularly it can be done. Will see how it goes, I had to take October off from work, so I'd better make the best out of it. Let's try to (micro)blog more often.

### 23 September 2022 - On Gumroad, Upwork and the Italian Reddit scene

I woke up super early this morning to catch a train to France. In the last two days I managed to work on some stuff.

- Twitter report: there are many posts on Upwork asking for freelancers to make a report on Twitter users and so on. I am thinking about freelancing on Upwork in the future, but I have nothing to show in my Portfolio. I took one job offer and tried to build the same thing the guy was asking about (report about followers, tweets, retweets of a user in the last week). I already wrote the script to extract this info from the API, and today I made a skeleton of the web app.

- Gumroad: I asked for advice on IH on increasing the number of reviews for my books. One I got was to ask for a review in the description. It could work. I have neglected those products for some time anyway, so I updated the descriptions to ask for reviews and add some more interesting info to attract potential customers.

Good news from Gumroad by the way. Today I sold 2 more copies. Total revenue for September 95 €. Not a bad result.

I also spent some time on Reddit these days. The ItaliaPersonalFinance sub is flooded with requests for advice on how to invest a small sum of money (around 10k). I just suggested to acquire a startup on MicroAcquire and try to make it grow. Many people got interested and started to ask me questions in my DMs. I am very happy I got this interest, will be great to know I inspired a person to grow a business online. Maybe there is also a product idea in it, some kind of curated list for MicroAcquire, who knows.

Sometimes I think it's just enough to put yourself out there, whatever you do.

### 21 September 2022 - I'm back

Yeah, this is the first post in Alex West style. Daily, short, and to the point. Let's see if I can keep it this way. I almost forgot how this Jekyll blog works after more than one year since the last post. Need to read the docs again.

Long day at work today, and I feel tired. I was toying with the idea of boosting sales for my two books and found out that Gumroad has an affiliate program (maybe Peter Codes spoke about it recently, I can't remember honestly).

This evening I went out and drafted a semi-generic email and sent it to two tipster websites. They rank pretty high on google and look like they have a big audience, one of them more than 10000. If I can reach even 1% of them (I don't expect more than that), I could sell another 100 copies, which could mean 1500 € or so.

Amazon KDP paid their royalties today. In August they were around 81 €. Not bad at all, considering I put 0 effort into marketing on KDP (and I wouldn't know where to start).

Also, I had a great chat with Gianluca today, a guy looking for a freelance Data Scientist for his newly founded company. I spread the word among my friends. I hope they can get some side gigs too.

Enough for today. I should work on my side projects more in the morning. I cannot find the time and energy in the evenings.
