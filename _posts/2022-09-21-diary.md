### 2 October 2022 - On Ads, Django and Moscow

Long time since the latest blog. Travelled a lot and discarded it unfortunately.

Some days ago I heard back from one of the tipsters websites. I planned to advertise my book on their newsletter. Turns out they do not run a newsletter, but I could place an ad on their website. Their quote is interesting and I think they have a large traffic (they rank pretty high on Google). I have asked them for a proof of traffic in August. As soon as I have it I will decide what to do, probably will run an ad for 1 month and see how it goes. For this reason, I spent some time designing a banner for the ad, it doesn't look horrible and it took me just a little time to do. Probably not worth making something professional and spending money on it, given I don't know how much it will convert. Once it's live and I have an idea of the conversion rate, I will see if it is worth it, and ask for a professional.

One of my book readers asked me for some advice on the application of the model with more advanced statistics. I do not have the time to go about this so I told him I would be able to do some consulting on it. Didn't go well, but I think it was the right move. Maybe one day I will be able to do some consulting.

Made some progress on the Twitter report tool, almost ready with a Django website for it. Probably will be ready by the end of the week, when I will try to put it live somewhere (render.com maybe?). Once it's live I will ahve something to show in my portfolio for Upwork.

I am in Moscow to visit family now. Quite difficult to work from here, but with VPNs and deleting cookies regularly it can be done. Will see how it goes, I had to take October off from work, so I'd better make the best out of it. Let's try to (micro)blog more often.

### 23 September 2022 - On Gumroad, Upwork and the Italian Reddit scene

I woke up super early this morning to catch a train to France. In the last two days I managed to work on some stuff.

- Twitter report: there are many posts on Upwork asking for freelancers to make a report on Twitter users and so on. I am thinking about freelancing on Upwork in the future, but I have nothing to show in my Portfolio. I took one job offer and tried to build the same thing the guy was asking about (report about followers, tweets, retweets of a user in the last week). I already wrote the script to extract this info from the API, and today I made a skeleton of the web app.

- Gumroad: I asked for advice on IH on increasing the number of reviews for my books. One I got was to ask for a review in the description. It could work. I have neglected those products for some time anyway, so I updated the descriptions to ask for reviews and add some more interesting info to attract potential customers.

Good news from Gumroad by the way. Today I sold 2 more copies. Total revenue for September 95 €. Not a bad result.

I also spent some time on Reddit these days. The ItaliaPersonalFinance sub is flooded with requests for advice on how to invest a small sum of money (around 10k). I just suggested to acquire a startup on MicroAcquire and try to make it grow. Many people got interested and started to ask me questions in my DMs. I am very happy I got this interest, will be great to know I inspired a person to grow a business online. Maybe there is also a product idea in it, some kind of curated list for MicroAcquire, who knows.

Sometimes I think it's just enough to put yourself out there, whatever you do.

### 21 September 2022 - I'm back

Yeah, this is the first post in Alex West style. Daily, short, and to the point. Let's see if I can keep it this way. I almost forgot how this Jekyll blog works after more than one year since the last post. Need to read the docs again.

Long day at work today, and I feel tired. I was toying with the idea of boosting sales for my two books and found out that Gumroad has an affiliate program (maybe Peter Codes spoke about it recently, I can't remember honestly).

This evening I went out and drafted a semi-generic email and sent it to two tipster websites. They rank pretty high on google and look like they have a big audience, one of them more than 10000. If I can reach even 1% of them (I don't expect more than that), I could sell another 100 copies, which could mean 1500 € or so.

Amazon KDP paid their royalties today. In August they were around 81 €. Not bad at all, considering I put 0 effort into marketing on KDP (and I wouldn't know where to start).

Also, I had a great chat with Gianluca today, a guy looking for a freelance Data Scientist for his newly founded company. I spread the word among my friends. I hope they can get some side gigs too.

Enough for today. I should work on my side projects more in the morning. I cannot find the time and energy in the evenings.
