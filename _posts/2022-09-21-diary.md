### 23 September 2022 - On Gumroad, Upwork and the Italian Reddit scene

I woke up super early this morning to catch a train to France. In the last two days I managed to work on some stuff.

- Twitter report: there are many posts on Upwork asking for freelancers to make a report on Twitter users and so on. I am thinking about freelancing on Upwork in the future, but I have nothing to show in my Portfolio. I took one job offer and tried to build the same thing the guy was asking about (report about followers, tweets, retweets of a user in the last week). I already wrote the script to extract this info from the API, and today I made a skeleton of the web app.

- Gumroad: I asked for advice on IH on increasing the number of reviews for my books. One I got was to ask for a review in the description. It could work. I have neglected those products for some time anyway, so I updated the descriptions to ask for reviews and add some more interesting info to attract potential customers.

Good news from Gumroad by the way. Today I sold 2 more copies. Total revenue for September 95 €. Not a bad result.

I also spent some time on Reddit these days. The ItaliaPersonalFinance sub is flooded with requests for advice on how to invest a small sum of money (around 10k). I just suggested to acquire a startup on MicroAcquire and try to make it grow. Many people got interested and started to ask me questions in my DMs. I am very happy I got this interest, will be great to know I inspired a person to grow a business online. Maybe there is also a product idea in it, some kind of curated list for MicroAcquire, who knows.

Sometimes I think it's just enough to put yourself out there, whatever you do.

### 21 September 2022 - I'm back

Yeah, this is the first post in Alex West style. Daily, short, and to the point. Let's see if I can keep it this way. I almost forgot how this Jekyll blog works after more than one year since the last post. Need to read the docs again.

Long day at work today, and I feel tired. I was toying with the idea of boosting sales for my two books and found out that Gumroad has an affiliate program (maybe Peter Codes spoke about it recently, I can't remember honestly).

This evening I went out and drafted a semi-generic email and sent it to two tipster websites. They rank pretty high on google and look like they have a big audience, one of them more than 10000. If I can reach even 1% of them (I don't expect more than that), I could sell another 100 copies, which could mean 1500 € or so.

Amazon KDP paid their royalties today. In August they were around 81 €. Not bad at all, considering I put 0 effort into marketing on KDP (and I wouldn't know where to start).

Also, I had a great chat with Gianluca today, a guy looking for a freelance Data Scientist for his newly founded company. I spread the word among my friends. I hope they can get some side gigs too.

Enough for today. I should work on my side projects more in the morning. I cannot find the time and energy in the evenings.
