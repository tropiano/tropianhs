I'm very late this month with the report. But I want to write it before the end of August.

Not much has happened last month. I kept freelancing, and **missed my target** of launching another product by the end of the month. I spent half of July traveling and this didn't help either.

On the positive side, I think I see a clear path forward, and it's not about building another SaaS. I've already started working on it and paused everything else.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

Paused for now.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

Paused too.

## [xTopics][xtopics]

Nothing new here.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Paused, not sure it will restart with the new season. For now it's not worth it.

## [Freelancing][personal]

Still doing it. I am keeping the number of projects low for now, because again, I want to keep some time free to pursue side projects. I am going to write more about this (including revenue and projects I work on) in [my TG channel][tg-datafreelance].

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month (without freelancing).

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $69.15       |
| Gumroad book sales | + $47.01       |
| Amazon Ads         | - $10.65       |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $6.65        |
| X Premium          | - $9.34        |
| HuggingFace        | - $3.17        |
| **Total**          | **+$76.35**    |

Reinvested sales money in ads for my Stoic quotes book. For now, it's not paying off, **I spend more than I earn**. But I will adjust the campaigns a bit in the future, and I'm confident they will get better.

I'm **focusing 100% on publishing** going forward. Building a product hasn't brought any revenue, and I'm sitting on a few books published in 2020 that are still making money today. It's time to double down on this.
