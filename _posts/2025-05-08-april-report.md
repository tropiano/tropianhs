Another late report. It's becoming the norm right now, but the main reason this month is that I am traveling and have very little time. And the time that I have, I prefer to spend it working.
Right now I am writing it from a cafe' in St. Petersburg. I took a couple of hours and left my wife and daughter in our hotel room. I hope they will not notice my absence.

These updates will be very short in the future. I guess they still count though.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

Ouch. no article written this month. Too busy freelancing, but at least it gave me some material for an article or two to write. Subscribers to my TG channel kept growing slowly. I have now **45 members, which is 6 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

I have sent 1 newsletter this month. Even here, more unsubscribes than subscribers and still nobody that wants to pay for a spot in the newsletter or the site.

I lost **2 subscribers in March, total is 2054 now**.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

No time to work on this. I only renewed the domain for another year. It's very hard to promote this project. Even when I go viral on Threads nobody visits the website, which is sad.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Usual work, with weekly posting on Reddit and on the TG channel. Unfortunately the bets are not going very well, which is really the only thing that matters to get new subscribers.

I have got now **38 subscribers on my YT channel, 5 more than last week** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 60, 13 more than last month**. I hope to get to 100 before the end of the football season.

## [Freelancing][personal]

Most of the time went on freelancing this month. I hope it's enough to pay the bills. After taxes I am afraid I am still under.

I paid the Italian taxes for 2023 this month. Roughly 10k taxes for 22k earnings. What the fuck.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $            |
| Domain renewals   | - $36.44       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $5.31        |
| X Premium         | - $10.68       |
| DeepSeek          | - $            |
| HuggingFace       | - $0.77        |
| Total             | + $105.01      |

Book **sales are in line with 2024**, which is a bad news because in the last months they have been increasing on average. Nothing new on the expenses side, and I am asking myself if I really should spend more now that I am making some money with freelancing. I could **maybe spend on advertising** to try to grow some of my side projects.
