Another late report. It's becoming the norm right now, but the main reason this month is that I am traveling and have very little time. And the time that I have, I prefer to spend it working.
Right now I am writing it from a cafe' in St. Petersburg. I took a couple of hours and left my wife and daughter in our hotel room. I hope they will not notice my absence.

These updates will be very short in the future. I guess they still count though.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

Ouch. no article written this month. Too busy freelancing, but at least it gave me some material for an article or two to write. Subscribers to my TG channel kept growing slowly. I have now **45 members, which is 6 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

I have sent 3 newsletters this month. Only skipped one week. But I didn't manage to sell any spot on the website. I should really push sales with cold emails and DMs for it to really work.

I lost **11 subscribers in April, total is 2030 now**.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I worked on making the landing page a bit more appealing. The main problem here is that nobody signs up. It's not only about marketing. The product needs some love too, and I need to make something that really works and is really useful, not just a nice to have.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Same as last month really.

I have got now **40 subscribers on my YT channel, 2 more than last month** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 68, 8 more than last month**. The problem is that I got banned from r/sportsbook. Too much promotion they say.

## [Freelancing][personal]

Most of the time went on freelancing this month. I hope it's enough to pay the bills. After taxes I am afraid I am still under.

I paid the Italian taxes for 2023 this month. Roughly 10k taxes for 22k earnings. What the fuck.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $            |
| Domain renewals   | - $36.44       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $5.31        |
| X Premium         | - $10.68       |
| DeepSeek          | - $            |
| HuggingFace       | - $0.77        |
| Total             | + $105.01      |

Book **sales are in line with 2024**, which is a bad news because in the last months they have been increasing on average. Nothing new on the expenses side, and I am asking myself if I really should spend more now that I am making some money with freelancing. I could **maybe spend on advertising** to try to grow some of my side projects.
