A couple of months ago [I announced on Twitter][tweet-postma] that I was going to follow Postma's recipe to build and grow a small business without an audience. Since I don't have an audience, I have less than 450 followers on Twitter, it looked like a perfect choice for me. It's almost 2 months since I launched the first of these 2 projects on PH, so it's time to see what happened.

## Data Internships

**TLDR: I launched on 5 June with a few internships position in the Database. SEO didn't take off, I made too many mistakes. Reddit likes it and I am sending a newsletter.**

- SEO is not working and I think I need to change a couple of things in the copy, the page names and the keywords in general, to make it more similar to the way users look for jobs on the internet. I also need to add those Job Posting structured data that Google likes so much.
- Twitter posting also didn't move the needle that much. People were interested but I get usually less than 200 impressions on the tweets where I place the link of [datainternships.co][datainternships.co]. Twitter algorithm doesn't like external links.
- On the positive side, I [posted the site link on r/datascience][r/datascience] and got a lot of attention last week. More than 150 users visited the website in one day. That community seems a lot more responsive to this type of content. I should probably write there more often in the future.
- The post on Reddit brought also a few subscribers to the newsletter. I sent the first issue to a bit more than 20 people today.

## Stoic Quotes

**TLDR: I launched it one month ago. SEO seems ok, Reddit loves it but cannot drive traffic on the site from there.**

- Some attention from SEO. It looks like I have hit some nice long-tail keywords there, but there is competition. For a while, I was very low in the ranking but I made a couple of optimizations (added images and improved the site speed) and maybe I am seeing the results in the last couple of days. Still, no clicks, but the position for some keywords went from 40 to 20.
- I have [started to post images with quotes on Reddit][r/stoicquotes] and some of those posts have been really appreciated. They were collecting something between 20 and 50 likes with 1.5k impressions in the last 48 hours. I have not placed any link to the site, because Reddit can be unforgiving and it's hard to place a link on an image. I might just leave it like this and see what happens.

So, overall, SEO has not kicked in for my projects. I am probably doing many mistakes in the implementation of the SEO strategy. I have made mistakes in the copy, in the site content, and in the website performance. However, the keyword research was done right. I can see that people react to the content I have on various communities (Reddit above all, I love Reddit).

I surely will give it more time. In the meantime, I will try to automate what I can and try to use more Reddit as a Marketing channel. Maybe in the end, the websites will still be there but they will be part of a bigger strategy involving many channels. Who said I need to completely rely on SEO. It's just another traffic channel after all.
