Another month another report. Looking at my notes, it seems such a long time ago. I guess that means I am making progress, or at least I am moving forward and doing things. Which is positive.

I started to meet new people again in June, which is something I didn't do since a very long time. Living in another country is complicated to find new people, but social media help. Despite all the hate and brainrot online, I still think social medias are a net positive in people's lives. Especially people that travel a lot and have non-standard interests.

Work-wise, I kept freelancing, this helps me have a stable income. Although I am not saving, and actually losing a few hundreds each month. Life is expensive in Moscow, and the exchange rate is not making it easier.

Time is still an issue, but getting better. I manage to find time to build on the side, especially at night and sometimes on weekends. I got into a routine where around 9 pm everybody is asleep, and I can build for 2-3 hours. I think that's what Pat Walls does. Focused work for 2 hours every day is enough to build a business.

But I feel like I'm a bit rusty and cannot ship as fast as before. That's why in June I decided to challenge myself. I am going to ship 3 products by the end of the Summer. Ideally one each month. Let's see if I can make it. The goal is to build some ship muscle, not to launch a big success. Low expectations.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

I didn't write any article this month. Too busy building. But I am going to start writing a write-up of my freelancing activities with full breakdown of revenue there. If you are interested just [follow the TG channel][tg-datafreelance].

Somehow subscribers keep increasing. There are now **65 members, which is 8 more** than last month. Maybe I can get top 100 before the SUmmer ends.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

No activity this month. I had a chat with [Fran Betteo][fran-x] on X the other day. Gave me some motivation, maybe with a bit of hustle I can get a few hundred bucks. Very inspiring story.

Subscribers were stable in **June at a total of 2030**.

## [xTopics][xtopics]

I [launched a Product Hunt trend tracker!][ph-launch] It's built on Product Hunt API, and it shows the trending topics in the top products that are launched on PH. The launch went well I must say. I got featured, with 130 upvotes I was in the top 20 of the day. Did it translate in sales? Not so far, but I got 15 new subscribers. None of them uses Threads, so I guess they are pretty much useless. But they might be an initial set of users in case I decided to pivot in the direction of a Tech trends tracker.

As I wrote before, this was not really an effort to launch a new product. It's been more to exercise my shipping muscle. I have already improved my boilerplate a lot and the next product I will launch will be even better.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Season over, no new updates. Will I keep working on it in the future? Not sure. As I wrote in the past, I have too many things going on and this is not bringing the results I expected (selling more books). I actually sell more books when I yap on X. Maybe the YT channel is still worth it though.

I have got now **45 subscribers on my YT channel, +5 from last month** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 72, 1 more than last month**.

## [Freelancing][personal]

Still doing it. I am keeping the number of projects low for now, because again, I want to keep some time free to pursue side projects. I am going to write more about this (including revenue and projects I work on) in [my TG channel][tg-datafreelance].

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month (without freelancing).

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $151.25      |
| Gumroad book sales | + $28.96       |
| Amazon Ads         | - $13.09       |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $6.65        |
| X Premium          | - $8.72        |
| HuggingFace        | - $3.17        |
| **Total**          | **+$138.58**   |

Last month I was thinking of reinvesting all money setting up ads for my books or paying for some API that could improve my products. I invested in Ads and saw a small uptick in sales, but unfortunately I cannot advertise my betting books on the platform. I am now trying to advertise my books of Stoic quotes, and it's going all right so far.

## The future

My immediate goal is to launch another small product. This is just to exercise my shipping muscle, I don't have expectations of big earnings. I will launch in mid-July, probably. My third project will most certainly be a book. I want to take self-publishing more seriously, and I think I can be successful at it. Let's see.
