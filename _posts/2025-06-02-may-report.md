This time the report comes more or less on time. In May I still spent quite a lot of time travelling but I also managed to find time to do a few things

- I started to work on a new feature for [xTopics][xtopics]. I keep postponing the launch, but I should be able to launch in June at some point.
- I found one new client for freelancing. It's not a big contract but it is very interesting and helps me pay the bills.
- I attended a [Startup conference][startupvillage] in Moscow and met a few interesting founders.

Quick update on my projects. Let's see how they went in May.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

I interviewed [Dominique][dom-x]. Super interesting guy that went into freelancing fresh off of Zurich ETH. Dominique is an amazing guy and he has a very inspiring story that my readers loved. I shared the story on X and got some new subscribers because of that. Lesson: I should share everything more often and on more platforms. I have now **57 members, which is 12 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

This one is paused right now. Didn't have time to work on it and I didn't even send newsletters. Which is probably very stupid since it's the project that gets more traffic overall (mostly from SEO). I think the only way forward for this project is to automate more job selection so that I don't spend hours curating jobs, and at the same time start sending massive cold emails to companies looking for sponsors.

Subscribers were stable in **May at a total of 2030**.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I worked on making the landing page a bit more appealing. The main problem here is that nobody signs up. It's not only about marketing. The product needs some love too, and I need to make something that really works and is really useful, not just a nice to have.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Same as last month really.

I have got now **40 subscribers on my YT channel, 2 more than last month** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 68, 8 more than last month**. The problem is that I got banned from r/sportsbook. Too much promotion they say. I have got to find an alternative channel. Maybe I should try with Telegram ads?

## [Freelancing][personal]

I kept freelancing in April. I am doing very interesting work, and it definitely helps me pay the bills.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month (without freelancing).

| Item                 | Income/Expense |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales    | + $40.77       |
| Domain renewals      | - $36.44       |
| Appliku              | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner              | - $6.36        |
| X Premium            | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace          | - $0.53        |
| Freelancing services | - $13.71       |
| Total                | - $23.24       |

Damn, this is the first month in a few years that I am spending more than I am making. **I feel like a VC funded startup** right now. And it's not a good feeling. Book sales are at an all-time low, and I don't think this is going to change, maybe there will be a rebound at the end of the year. But in the short term I am not expecting one. I guess if **publishing the translation of the book in Spanish** has had any effect on the sales? I will wait until the end of May, and then I will try to take it off the market to see if it makes a difference.

## The future

This might be and definitely is a problem for a distant future, or whenever I ÃŸhave time. What to focus on? It's clear that **right now nothing is working**, but it's not clear in which direction to go. I might try to write another book, or maybe I can try to launch another product, since **I have 58 different ideas** for new products in my Trello board. Maybe I should launch a directory of not-validated startup ideas? Or maybe almost validated? Some of those ideas are interesting and have some validation like a viral tweet, or a feature request on a specific competitor tool. I will add this to the list. Now it's 59.
