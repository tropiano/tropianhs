I have worked on one more project this month. Actually, another book. I left the rest of the projects on the sideline for this month at least. Will probably keep working on them after June, it depends on how the new book will go.

I have noticed that I am starting spending more for things related to my projects. Before I was just spending on hosting and domains. Now I have started spending on courses, ads, even considering spending for professional services like a book cover design. I hope those will bring returns, but for now my only stream of income are still t **books I published 4 years ago**. Ideally I would like to build a product, but I am becoming more and more open to the idea of making money with whatever it takes. Maybe a course, maybe another book.

Right now I have a few things going on in parallel, and I am focusing a day of the week to each of them.

## [Euro 2024 book][euro2024]

I saw the opportunity to write about the upcoming Euro 2024 tournament and write another book in the soccer analytics series. Since the first two are my only source of income at the moment, I thought I would do more of this. Since it works, just do more of it as Hormozi often says. As I often do, I was browsing on Amazon and I noticed a few generic books about the Euros doing quite well already. The kind of books that come out with each major tournament. Some of them were already at the top in several categories, and must have made thousands of dollars every month.

So, on May 18 I set up a pre-order page on Gumroad and on Amazon KDP. I wrote down an email with the basic outline of the book, just a list of topics I would be writing about. And I sent the email to all my readers. I have been collecting their emails via Gumroad in the past years and I have also collected all emails of the readers who bought my books on Amazon. I always place my contact email in my book and offer all my readers to send them the code in the book if they write me. Works pretty well to build a mailing list.

I have then updated my readers on the progress of the book and published chapter by chapter, like in the old days. I think they liked it. Out of the 157 readers who received my email, I think 25 ordered my book before it was finished. It is actually only available on Gumroad for now, it will be available on Amazon from the 7th of June.
I think I have 20-25 hard-core readers, that really like what I write, trust me, and would read almost anything from me. It's around 15% of all my readers probably, and it might be some kind of universal law. Imagine selling 1 Million copies of a book. Then, you can assume 15% of those readers are going to become your hard-core fans. It's 150000 people, who will buy virtually anything you write. Pretty big deal.

I have published the book on Gumroad on June 3, and it will be out on Amazon on June 7. As of today, I have sold a bit fewer than 30 copies. What would I consider a success? Probably 100 copies across all platforms would be good. Given that it will not sell after the Euros, it would already have collected almost as many sales as my less successful book.

I am spending the days up to the start of the tournament (and probably more) doing some marketing. My strategy is simple

- Write a short blog post on [my soccrbets website][soccrbets] with the main results of the book and a link for people who want to know more.
- Write a short version of the blog post and point to the blog post if they wanna know more.
- Post the short version of the blog post on several subreddits and online groups.

It's kind of a funnel that has worked well for me in the past, and it minimizes the risk of being banned on Reddit. So far, it's working on 2 out of the 3 subreddits I have posted on. I wish I could find more communities to advertise to, outside of Reddit. But it's been a challenge for me to find active soccer groups that allow long form post with links.

Apart from blog posts, I am also doing Ads with Amazon, but this only works for the KDP version, not for the Gumroad one. I have hired [Levi][levi-twitter] to create a nice video for me. He did a great job, let's hope the ad attracts some traffic before the beginning of the tournament.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

As I wrote above, I left some prpjects on the sideline. With Data Internships, this month also brought another challenge to the tech side. I think LinkedIn has partially banned my IP address, and I am not able to collect as many job as I want. For this reason I have stopped sending the newsletter. It's at least 3 weeks since I sent the last one. How to solve it? Probably I need to use a proxy, but I still need to research how that is done and where to find it. I have never done it before, so it will take me a while before I figure out what to do, and I have a feeling it will not be cheap.

On the other hand, it looks like ConvertKit made it free for everyone to recommend other creators. So, I got a recommendation from a pretty big newsletter and my subscribers shot from something around 220 to almost 390 in less than 2 weeks. Maybe they are not very engaged, but they keep coming and I have a feeling I could get more of them if I start to look actively for more recommendations.

Another option for me would be to pivot this. My audience is made of Junior Data Scientists and AI enthusiasts, so I could start to repurpose some of my content on freelancing, or maybe write about the technical things I do around data analysis during the week. I like newsletters like the one from [Pete][pete-twitter] or Marc Lou. I know I can read them in 5-10 minutes, they will give me food for thought and I almost always end up clicking on some of those links and reading further. It's a good model I would like to copy.

Google doesn't love me, after the last update in March **I have lost 80% of my traffic from search**. I am not ranking anymore for queries like "data science internships" or "data analyst internships". I am not sure why, I cannot see anything wrong with my Search Console dashboard. Right now even Bing sends me more traffic than Google.

Subscribers growth last month was about 3.5%, and **I reached 210 subs in total**. Growing steadily, but I am trying to be more active on LinkedIn and posting twice a week instead of once. This has the potential to bring me even more traffic.

## Stoic Quotes

I **shut it down** last month, letting the domain expire. It started as an SEO experiment, following the famous Danny Postma tweet about building a business without an audience. I probably was very naive and went for an idea with little potential for monetization. I cannot say that I didn't try it all. I tried to get traffic through SEO, Twitter, through Reddit, created merch and also published a book. In the end, I couldn't make even $1 from it. Probably it's a winner take it all market. It's always hard to know why something failed, there could be a million reasons.

One takeaway from this, **it's not ok to follow someone else path, no matter how famous he is**. Play your own strengths and learn from your own experiences. There are many good lessons in entrepreneurship, but there is no playbook.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

This is the project I launched last month. Some people subscribed, but **I don't have paying users yet**. I have 15 early subscribers. Some of them have used the product only once. Most of them have just subscribed and never used the product. I have sent an email with updates on the tool (added the possibility to upload multiple files and working now on AI generated tweets) and 3 out of 15 people opened, which suggests me only a small fraction of the users even remembers about the tool.

I am also chatting with a few people trying to understand better the market for this kind of product. I am **experimenting with a chat based on your past tweets** now, fine-tuning existing models on the tweet history of users. I am going to share the updates in public and see if it sparks some interest.

At this point, with 0 users, it's not useful to invest time in fixing bugs, the UX or adding features. It's better to play more with the tech, talk to potential users, and see if it can pivot into something interesting.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

This is more an SEO experiment, a way to **bring more people to my books about Soccer Betting**. The idea is to write an article every month (or even more) on common questions around soccer betting and start to rank on Google.

I have written an article on BTTS this month. Once I have another 2 or 3 articles, I will start to focus on backlinks.

## New products

When I was freelancing the main pain was to **find new clients**, so I am toying with an idea can build something that helps with that. I have been in touch with a few people with whom I worked in the past year and other people that are starting out as freelancers.

My idea is to deliver them a few opportunities per month, from companies that are likely to hire agencies or freelancers. A bit like a lead generation agency, but specific for Data Science. From the conversation I had, it is something that could solve a problem, but **I didn't hear the screams of pain** from the people I talked to. Instead, I heard some excitement around the idea of a **community of people who are freelancing in Data Science**, to share their wins, their strategies and their struggles. Could this be the way forward? A paid community? I heard communities are extremely hard to build and to keep alive, but it could really be something that people want and could solve a pain point, for Data Science agency founders that feel a bit alone in their journey.

For now, I have set up a landing page, focused on generating leads for the people who subscribe. It's called [datafreelance][datafreelance].

## The cashflow

As always, let's take a close look at the revenue and expenses this month.

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $173.32      |
| Gumroad book sales | + $45.97       |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $5.31        |
| Twitter blue       | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace        | - $0.32        |
| Brev               | - $0.32        |
| KW Everywhere      | - $21.96       |
| Italian PEC email  | - $13.11       |
| Ads                | - $65          |
| Total              | + $133.20      |

Record income from my books on Amazon. I don't know exactly why, April has been my worst-performing month in the past years. I even stopped the ads in March because they didn't look that profitable. Could it be a long-term effect of the ads? People see the book, maybe they save it in their wish list and then buy it later? Let's see if the trend continues or if it's been a one-time thing.

I have made a little investment in a [Telegram course][telegram-maria] too. I consider it as a business expense, because it will give me the opportunity to explore another channel, with the goal to turn it into a revenue generating activity. It looks interesting and it caught my attention. I have seen it first on a tweet, followed the landing page, the copy looked convincing, and I bought after a few days. I almost never buy this kind of products, so I analyzed my behavior and those are the things that I noticed:

- I saw the author message multiple times before finally buying, and visited the landing page a few times before convincing myself to finally pull out my card.
- The author mentioned how much she makes from the channels she manages ($5k).
- I liked that the author has a similar story to mine (Analyst to Entrepreneur).
- The author spent time replying to my questions on X.
- The discounted price sounds right (most courses are around $50-100).
- She had testimonials. Even if the course is not ready, there was a good review about the author, that made me confident the purchase is worth the money I am paying.

I think there is a lot to learn from the points above, and I will try to take inspiration from them to market my products.

## Life

This month I also travelled quite a lot. Visited Tallinn, and I had a great time. The city center reminded me of one of my favorite games, [Patrician 3][patrician-3]. And most importantly, I (quite randomly) met [Daniele][dan], who is an Italian Digital entrepreneur living abroad. Dan is one of these guys who are not very vocal on X. He does not have a huge following, does not make much noise. He builds good software, speaks to his customers and has a great healthy business, that gives him stability and the freedom to experiment with new ideas. It was great meeting with him in person, more of us should meet in person more often.
