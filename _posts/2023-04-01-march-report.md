It's that time of the month again, let's dig up some data and look at how much money I am making on the side.

| Item                   | Income/Expense |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales      | +150.77 $      |
| Gumroad book sales     | +16.21 $       |
| Upwork freelancing     | +651.17 $      |
| Digital Ocean droplets | -4.88 $        |
| Total                  | +813.27 $      |

A great month overall.

Book sales are the highest they have ever been. I am not doing any marketing but it looks like people are discovering my book and there is more and more interest in betting and analytical approaches to betting. I have also been more active on Twitter and social media in general so that might have brought more traffic to it.

Upwork makes up 80% of my side income, in March I worked 5 hours per week on average, on Saturdays, Sundays and one or two weekdays. I think I can keep working at this rate in the next months, when I will be unemployed it will be even better. This comes from a single contract, so having another one or two should increase this amount substantially.
