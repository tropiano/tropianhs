September was all about writing the book. The release date should be around mid-November. And hopefully it can become a good Christmas gift and get a few sales in Q4. This report will be boring, I have decided to focus only on **freelancing to pay the bills**, and on **self-publishing** to build a stable and growing side-income business.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

Paused.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

Paused.

## [xTopics][xtopics]

Paused. Gotta fix it at some point, but this is not my priority now and it will only be a distraction.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Paused.

## [Freelancing][personal]

Still doing it, otherwise I won't be able to put food on the table. I have two clients and I don't plan to add more. I usually write updates on it a dedicated [TG channel][tg-datafreelance].

## [Publishing][publishing]

I have written 3 chapters this month. Now the **book is at around 85 pages**. I plan to write a couple more chapters, that should bring it to 120 pages overall. My main competitors with a Best Selling Rank below 100k wrote books in the 120-200 pages range and I think that should be enough for a beginner's book.

I have also set up [a website][physicsbookspress] to collect readers' emails and make my small publishing house look a bit more official.

I am still **experimenting with ads** for my other books. I think I have reached the optimal point, but they are still not really profitable, it might be a question of timing, but anyway the spend is limited and I can afford it.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month (without freelancing).

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $59.52       |
| Amazon Ads        | - $27.21       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $6.65        |
| X Premium         | - $8.72        |
| Domain purchase   | - $20.92       |
| **Total**         | **-$13.98**    |

Another month with a negative return. I welcome these months, it means investment in the future.
Let's hope it pays off.
Till the next month!
