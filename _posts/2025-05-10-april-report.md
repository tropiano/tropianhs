Another late report. It's becoming the norm right now, but the main reason this month is that I am traveling and have very little time. And the time that I have, I prefer to spend it working.
Right now I am writing it from a cafe in St. Petersburg. I took a couple of hours and left my wife and daughter in our hotel room. I hope they will not notice my absence.

These updates will be very short in the future. I guess they still count though.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

Ouch. no article written this month. Too busy freelancing, but at least it gave me some material for an article or two to write. Subscribers to my TG channel kept growing slowly. I have now **45 members, which is 6 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

I have sent 3 newsletters this month. Only skipped one week. But I didn't manage to sell any spot on the website. I should really push sales with cold emails and DMs for it to really work.

I lost **11 subscribers in April, total is 2030 now**.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I worked on making the landing page a bit more appealing. The main problem here is that nobody signs up. It's not only about marketing. The product needs some love too, and I need to make something that really works and is really useful, not just a nice to have.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Same as last month really.

I have got now **40 subscribers on my YT channel, 2 more than last month** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 68, 8 more than last month**. The problem is that I got banned from r/sportsbook. Too much promotion they say. I have got to find an alternative channel. Maybe I should try with Telegram ads?

## [Freelancing][personal]

I kept freelancing in April. I am doing very interesting work, and it definitely helps me pay the bills.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month (without freelancing).

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $40.77       |
| Domain renewals   | - $36.44       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $5.31        |
| X Premium         | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace       | - $0.53        |
| Total             | - $22.19       |

Damn, this is the first month in a few years that I am spending more than I am making. I feel like a VC funded startup right now. And it's not a good feeling. Book sales are at an all-time low, and I don't think this is going to change, maybe there will be a rebound at the end of the year. But in the short term I am not expecting one. I guess if publishing the translation of the book in Spanish has had any effect on the sales? I will wait until the end of May, and then I will try to take it off the market to see if it makes a difference.

## The future

This might be and definitely is a problem for a distant future. What to focus on? It's clear that right now nothing is working, but it's not clear in which direction to go. I might try to write another book, or maybe I can try to launch another product, since I have 58 different ideas for new products in my Trello board. Maybe I should launch a directory of not-validated startup ideas? Or maybe almost validated? Some of those ideas are interesting and have some validation like a viral tweet, or a feature request on a specific competitor tool. I will add this to the list. Now it's 59.
