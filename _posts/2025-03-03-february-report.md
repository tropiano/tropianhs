In February I have defintely shifted back to building on-the side and spending most of my free time freelancing. This will bring some financial stability and, as things start to get a bit easier with the bay, I think I can still dedicate some of my time growing my following and building features and new products.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

I really wanted to write a new article this month, but I didn't find the time. I hope to write 2 articles in March instead. Looking at the stats, I have got **19 members, which is 6 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

Since Google has decided to **gift me some more traffic** in their last update in December, I have started to work a bit more on this. I sent 2 newsletters in January, and plan to send another couple in February.

But my subscribers' growth has stagnated. I am now around 2050 subscribers, almost 20 less than last month. I am still not sure **how to monetize** this, and I haven't made any effort to list and sell it on any platform. I have also reached the point where I should automate the process a bit more, because I am spending too much time reviewing the job offers. Once I have done that, I will try to sell newsletter ads, or even try to become an affiliate for some Data Science related course.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I have been slacking on this. No new feature, and very little, maybe even **zero promotion** on socials.

I have already started working on it again in February. The goal is to convert a few registered users into customers. There are too many of them who register and don't even connect their Threads account.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

I kept improving automations and publishing **new articles**. I also tried to automate the Reddit posting, so now I am now able to fire a script that auto-posts the latest suggested bets when needed. I also published a 2-parts analytics article, and a couple of new videos on my personal YT channel. January sales are not as good as December, but I think these videos are still contributing to **bring more visitors** to my books on Gumroad and Amazon. I should see the effect on sales in the next weeks.

I have got now **30 subscribers on my YT channel** and the subscribers on the TG channel grew up to 31.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $119.97      |
| X Rev share       | + $10.57       |
| Domain renewals   | - $10.44       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $5.31        |
| X Premium         | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace       | - $0.86        |
| Total             | + $79.00       |

Overall, **book sales decreased a lot**. Which is expected in January. If I compare it with last year, I am just $5 below. This month I also managed to keep the HuggingFace costs down at the expected levels. And I got paid for my **shitposting on X**, which is always nice because I love to do it. I also bought TG Premium for one year. A bit of an experiment, but I hope it will help me grow my channels.

I am now **below $100 in revenue**, which is worrying, and the main reason why I started to look for freelancing gigs. I will be working with a friend who owns an Italian agency in February, and that should give me some room to breathe for a few months. Let's see how it goes.
