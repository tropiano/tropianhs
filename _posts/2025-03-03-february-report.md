In February I have defintely shifted back to building on-the side and spending most of my free time freelancing. This will bring some financial stability and, as things start to get a bit easier with the bay, I think I can still dedicate some of my time growing my following and building features and new products.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

I really wanted to write a new article this month, but I didn't find the time. I hope to write 2 articles in March instead. People keep subscribing, I have now **27 members, which is 8 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

No newsletter sent this month. But I improved the website a bit, now it has a slightly better look and the DB is more stable. There are still some hiccups in the job fetching mechanism. My plan is to solve them next, and then launch again on ProductHunt, trying to sell the project.

I added less than 10 subscribers in February, with the total slightly above 2060 now.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I have done a few improvements on the website, mostly usability and UX stuff, no new fancy feature.
My main problem is that people subscribe, but they don't use the product. They don't even connect their Threads account, which doesn't make any sense.

I have got to contact these potential customers and understand what is holding them back.

Lots of work on it. I keep improving automation and publishing articles on the blog and on Telegram. I renewed the domain and now I am  My  I kept improving automations and publishing **new articles**. I also tried to automate the Reddit posting, so now I am now able to fire a script that auto-posts the latest suggested bets when needed. I also published a 2-parts analytics article, and a couple of new videos on my personal YT channel. January sales are not as good as December, but I think these videos are still contributing to **bring more visitors** to my books on Gumroad and Amazon. I should see the effect on sales in the next weeks.

I have got now **30 subscribers on my YT channel** and the subscribers on the TG channel grew up to 31.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $119.97      |
| X Rev share       | + $10.57       |
| Domain renewals   | - $10.44       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $5.31        |
| X Premium         | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace       | - $0.86        |
| Total             | + $79.00       |

Overall, **book sales decreased a lot**. Which is expected in January. If I compare it with last year, I am just $5 below. This month I also managed to keep the HuggingFace costs down at the expected levels. And I got paid for my **shitposting on X**, which is always nice because I love to do it. I also bought TG Premium for one year. A bit of an experiment, but I hope it will help me grow my channels.

I am now **below $100 in revenue**, which is worrying, and the main reason why I started to look for freelancing gigs. I will be working with a friend who owns an Italian agency in February, and that should give me some room to breathe for a few months. Let's see how it goes.
