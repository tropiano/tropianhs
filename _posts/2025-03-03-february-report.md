I'm starting the year shifting focus again. If 2024 was the year to go all-in bootstrapping a product, 2025 is going to be the year when I am stabilizing my finances and take a **less risky approach** to entrepreneurship.

This is why I have been spending a lot of time this month applying to part-time positions, networking and sending CVs. The idea is to have one or more part-time gigs that will help me **reduce the stress on my finances**, increase my runway and make my wife less worried. Now that we have a baby to take care of, I can't afford to take too many risks.

I have spent some time this month writing and publishing a **new article on the channel**. The inspiration for these articles often comes from talking to other Data Scientists that want to start freelancing. They write me in private (usually on Reddit) and I just answer their questions. These conversations turn into an article like [the first one that went viral][freelance-article] more than one year ago, and still brings hundreds of people to this website every month. A guy contacted me on X, I replied to his questions and turned that chat into an article.

I already have something in mind to write this month, and I think I will have more and more to talk about once I start freelancing again. Looking at the stats, I have got **19 members, which is 6 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

Since Google has decided to **gift me some more traffic** in their last update in December, I have started to work a bit more on this. I sent 2 newsletters in January, and plan to send another couple in February.

But my subscribers' growth has stagnated. I am now around 2050 subscribers, almost 20 less than last month. I am still not sure **how to monetize** this, and I haven't made any effort to list and sell it on any platform. I have also reached the point where I should automate the process a bit more, because I am spending too much time reviewing the job offers. Once I have done that, I will try to sell newsletter ads, or even try to become an affiliate for some Data Science related course.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I have been slacking on this. No new feature, and very little, maybe even **zero promotion** on socials.

I have already started working on it again in February. The goal is to convert a few registered users into customers. There are too many of them who register and don't even connect their Threads account.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

I kept improving automations and publishing **new articles**. I also tried to automate the Reddit posting, so now I am now able to fire a script that auto-posts the latest suggested bets when needed. I also published a 2-parts analytics article, and a couple of new videos on my personal YT channel. January sales are not as good as December, but I think these videos are still contributing to **bring more visitors** to my books on Gumroad and Amazon. I should see the effect on sales in the next weeks.

I have got now **30 subscribers on my YT channel** and the subscribers on the TG channel grew up to 31.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item                      | Income/Expense |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales         | + $119.97      |
| X Rev share               | + $10.57       |
| Domain renewals | - $24.69       |
| Appliku                   | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner                   | - $5.31        |
| X Premium                 | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace               | - $0.86        |
| Total                     | + $79.00       |

Overall, **book sales decreased a lot**. Which is expected in January. If I compare it with last year, I am just $5 below. This month I also managed to keep the HuggingFace costs down at the expected levels. And I got paid for my **shitposting on X**, which is always nice because I love to do it. I also bought TG Premium for one year. A bit of an experiment, but I hope it will help me grow my channels.

I am now **below $100 in revenue**, which is worrying, and the main reason why I started to look for freelancing gigs. I will be working with a friend who owns an Italian agency in February, and that should give me some room to breathe for a few months. Let's see how it goes.
