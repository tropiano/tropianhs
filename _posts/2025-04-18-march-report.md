Wow. It's almost April and I am only now starting to write the March report.

This has been a very busy month, but I feel like I accomplished nothing, and I am probably right. I thought that by the time my daughter turned 6 months I would be able to go back to working 4 days a week for 5 hours, but it has not happened. And since I need to focus on my freelancing at least 3 days per week, this doesn't leave me any time for pursuing side projects seriously.

To be fair, I still can spend 1-2 hours per day to work on my projects, but those are usually late night, after 9 pm. Which is not the best time to be productive. My daughter wakes up at 6.30 am, so I cannot really work in the early morning either. And during the day, I am lucky if I can work 30 minutes without interruption, which clearly kills my productivity. Losing focus, it takes me twice as long to finish a task.

I guess I am screwed, and I don't even know if it makes sense anymore to pursue this crazy dream of indie hacking, when my main aim right now is to earn enough money to survive. Which is a sad state of things, considering that I am almost 42 and by now I should have a house (still renting), some sizeable investment assets (I have less than 15k) and I should at least not spend more than I earn (I am biting into my savings at the rate of 2k per month). At this rate, drastic choices would need to be made that could change not only my professional path but my life path and the destiny of my little family.

Anyway, let's just fill the numbers and go back to try to work. Right now I am traveling and I have even less time to do this.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

I wrote two new articles in March. I think those are good and helpful, but nobody is subscribing to the channel. I have now **39 members, which is 12 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

I have sent 1 newsletter this month. Even here, more unsubscribes than subscribers and still nobody that wants to pay for a spot in the newsletter or the site.

I lost **2 subscribers in March, total is 2054 now**.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

No time to work on this. I only renewed the domain for another year. It's very hard to promote this project. Even when I go viral on Threads nobody visits the website, which is sad.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Usual work, with weekly posting on Reddit and on the TG channel. Unfortunately the bets are not going very well, which is really the only thing that matters to get new subscribers.

I have got now **38 subscribers on my YT channel, 5 more than last week** and the subscribers on the **TG channel grew to 60, 13 more than last month**. I hope to get to 100 before the end of the football season.

## [Freelancing][personal]

Most of the time went on freelancing this month. I hope it's enough to pay the bills. After taxes I am afraid I am still under.

I paid the Italian taxes for 2023 this month. Roughly 10k taxes for 22k earnings. What the fuck.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item              | Income/Expense |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $144.59      |
| Domain renewals   | - $10.44       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner           | - $5.31        |
| X Premium         | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace       | - $0.77        |
| Total             | + $107.39      |

Book **sales are in line with 2024**, which is a bad news because in the last months they have been increasing on average. Nothing new on the expenses side, and I am asking myself if I really should spend more now that I am making some money with freelancing. I could **maybe spend on advertising** to try to grow some of my side projects.
