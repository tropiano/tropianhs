I almost didn't write this post, but then read last year one and **it was so good** that I found the motivation. I want to read this blog post again next year and see how I grew. They say _never compare yourself to others, only to your younger self_.

## [Data Freelance][tg-datafreelance]

Slowed down a lot on this. I simply **cannot find the time** to take care about my family, and consistently post once a week about freelancing. Maybe once a month is a more reasonable schedule. Or whenever I feel I have something to say. People will keep coming to the TG channel anyway. My main idea was to capture those people who read my Reddit [article on freelancing][datafreelance-blog] of 1 year ago anyway.

Quick look at the channel subscribers this month, **13 members, which is 6 more** than last month.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

I don't know anything about SEO anymore. Or better, I know that Google decides arbitrarily when to show your website in results or not.

In **March 2024 I was obliterated** by one of the Google updates. In 1 week my traffic from search went from 60 clicks per day to 1 or 2. They just took all queries like "data analyst internship", "data analyst intern", "business analyst internship" and so on, and gave me exactly 0 impressions for those. I am sure I was put in **some kind of blacklist** for some reason. So I stopped working actively on the website. But look what happened at the end of December. **Google just decided to give me back all the traffic**, and now I already rank in first page for some of those keywords above. Strange right?

What should I do now? From one side, it looks like a great opportunity, from the other side, I don't want to get burned again my another unfriendly Google update. Maybe the solution is to **focus on it for 1 month** with a clear objective in mind. That could be either selling the website or get a few customers.

I have got 2068 subscribers to the mailing list right now, and a bit more of 300 users in the last 30 days.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

Little work on the product this month. I added a few filters for the most popular topics leaderboard and implemented a filter to show only comments instead of both posts and comments. This is something that I find very useful. Every time I sit at my desk and plan the content for the following week, one of my **main inspiration is the replies I made** to someone else comment. It's a quick idea to repurpose some high engagement comments into a post of its own.

The new feature made the dashboard a bit clunky. Every time you press the filter, there is a full refresh of the page that is a bit disturbing. I heard that `htmx` could solve this problem, by reloading only some part of the page, and I am going to try to implement it soon.

No new paying users this month, but a couple of non-paying ones, that **I need to try to convert somehow**. Overall, progress is very slow. I wish it was easier to convert more customers, but I am also aware that I should spend much more time doing marketing and polishing the product if I want to see it succeed.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

Improving automations and publishing new articles have been the main activities this month. I cannot say these have been bringing me a lot of customers, but I know that this activity has an impact, and it reflects on both my Amazon and Gumroad sales. Some people will **read my posts or watch the videos** and just go straight to Amazon because they like physical books.

I posted [another video][soccrbets-video] on YT. Now I have 25 subscribers. It was 15 a month ago, slowly improving. I will try to publish more than one video per month and maybe even stream from time to time. And I also kept posting on Reddit and my [TG channel][telegram-soccrbets]. My subscribers on the TG channel grew up to 26.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $208.76      |
| Gumroad book sales | + $13.11       |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $5.31        |
| Twitter blue       | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace        | - $8.81        |
| Total              | + $187.07      |

Slightly below $200, which seems more or less what I have been gravitating around for the whole year. I am trying to move the needle a bit on books. On a yearly scale, I am improving the sales definitely with respect to 2023. On the other hand, **the progress has not been a 10x**, which makes it difficult to consider it a good reliable source of income.
HF bill jumped up. I am not sure why, but I need to keep an eye on it.

What will happen in 2025? I am not sure. I will have to **go back freelancing**, certainly. Otherwise, I will have no money to pay the rent. And to freelance I need to find the time to do it. This week I was **barely able to work for 10 hours**. The rest of the time I spent it doing house chores and helping my 4-months daughter and my wife. I don't know how people do it with a full time job.
