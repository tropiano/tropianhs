It was a good start to the year with work coming from many clients, but in the end, everything quickly turned upside down, when **I lost 2 of my clients** during the month (btw they still owe me money), and I am going to lose another one by the end of February.
That means I will have to go back and look for other clients if I want to keep putting food on the table, but it is also an opportunity to carve out some time to launch a few side projects, which is the ultimate goal.

I have used some **free time** in January to launch the book about [Stoic Quotes][stoic-quotes]. It was an opportunity to sell my sawdust. After spending some time collecting many Stoic philosophy quotes for the website, I had the idea of compiling them into a book. Used a bit of Python programming and Latex and I wrote a 200-page book with 20 lines of code (or less). Small bet worth taking. Let's see how it goes.

Monthly revenue took a hit of course, but it is expected, and it will continue in the next couple of months.

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $126.33      |
| Gumroad book sales | + $13          |
| Freelancing        | + $4800        |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $5.31        |
| Azure              | - $4.39        |
| ilo.so             | - $72.33       |
| Twitter blue       | - $10.68       |
| Total              | + $4836.62     |

Ok, big spend on my favorite Twitter Analytics tool for a yearly plan. I hope it will pay off. To be honest, I am seeing already a **good growth in engagement on Twitter** since I am scheduling my tweets with ilo. I thought it was a useless tool, but it helps to have a place where I can write down my thoughts, refine them and schedule for the next week. It has become a Sunday afternoon habit already.  
And the Twitter Blue is probably worth it too, but the Analytics is still **quite broken**. I had to download manually all my past tweets and process them with Python, to do a decent analysis of the ones that performed better. If you are curious, [check this tweet][tweet-analysis].

The usual stable revenue from the **book sales** (I have just got a couple of sales while writing this post) and in general I am looking to improve a bit the quality and positioning of the books I have published. They seem to sell well, no matter what, so I have done two or three things that could give a push to sales:

- set up a **discount code** on Gumroad for both soccer betting books (lasts until the end of AFCON)
- set up an **upsell** on the book to sell them together (with a nice discount)
- created an **ad campaign** on KDP, a bit of an experiment
- created a 2 **book series** on KDP, to boost the second book sales

It will be interesting to see the results of the ad experiment. The last time I tried it didn't go very well, but maybe I was not targeting **the right audience**. I posted an ad on a website, and I am not even sure how many people saw it. This time I pay per click and I can keep track of things and analyze what works and what doesn't.

I am going to **pause freelancing** for a bit in the next months, at least until March. I will focus 100% on side projects, I will launch a few products and try to get some traction. I have already spoken about the Stoic Book and the efforts to improve existing book sales. The other project I am working on is [Data internships][datainternships]. I have started **contacting recruiters** online since last Monday. So far I have written to 8 of them. Trying just to introduce myself and the project, without selling them anything. Only **1 reply** and she was not interested. But I will keep trying, until I contact **at least 20-30 people** and get at least 10 replies. If I get no sales after that, probably I should give up. I can still put the project somehow on autopilot, and see the traffic grow. Given it's **100% programmatic SEO**, it should just grow steadily if I keep pushing content and job offers, even without manually curating them.
For Data internships I have also prepared a **salary report** in the last week (I think it took me 3-4 days) using the data I have collected in the last months. It should help to get a few more students interested in the newsletter, but maybe it will attract also the interest of a few businesses looking **to hire an intern** and maybe purchase an ad on the website.
