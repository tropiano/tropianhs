Finally a write up that appears in the first week of the month.

In January, I spent most of my time writing and launching the first book of the year. This is a short book, not like [Quantum Physics for Beginners][book-link]. And it's aimed at selling around a specific holiday in February. And it's not Valentine's Day. Can't say much more about it. But it's definitely an experiment that, so far, is going quite well.

I kept freelancing, but not more than 2 days per week. Will I look for other freelancing opportunities? Let's say not in the next couple of months.

I kept spending on ads for [the Quantum Physics book][book-link] in January too, but with a reduced budget. Around the beginning of January I managed to reach was around 60k, which corresponds to 4-5 sales per day. the at the end of the November I **spent aggressively on ads** for the whole of December. I found out that December is probably the worst month to launch, since ads are very expensive. Also, I think I made a mistake launching the e-book and the paperback at the same time. Note to myself, next time do:

- Publish the e-book
- Gather reviews for the first 2-3 weeks (10 or 15 should be enough)
- Publish the paperback
- Run ads after

The launch was quite slow, but I managed to **sell 169 copies** of the book (40 paperbacks and 129 e-book copies) including the free ones. My main goal this month was to gather reviews, and I was able to get to 15, but I think I can get more, especially because some of my ARC readers have not submitted one yet.

Since it's very hard to get reviews these days, it's unrealistic for me to push much harder. It won't help my rank unless I get to 100 reviews and **I do not have the budget** for it. But I hope to slowly get them organically over the next few months. I am keeping my e-book price very as low as I can at $0.99 and this helps to attract some readers that might leave a review. So basically, I use the e-book for the reviews, I'll make the money with the paperback.

My BSR (Best Seller Rank) as of today is 152K, but **I could get as low as 52k** at the beginning of January. Ideally I would keep it lower than 100k, but I would have to spend much more on ads.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month (without freelancing).

| Item              | Income/Expense                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon book sales | + $205.60                                       |
| Book Ads          | - $290.51                                       |
| Appliku           | - $10.00                                        |
| Hetzner           | - $6.65                                         |
| X Premium         | - $8.72                                         |
| Grammarly         | - $14.00                                        |
| CoPilot           | - $9.68                                         |
| Ideogram          | - $25.00                                        |
| **Total**         | <span style="color: red;"> **-$158.96** </span> |

I am in **terrible red**. But I was expecting it, especially with the money spent on ads for the book launch. January seems to be already at break-even or even slightly profitable.

The book promotion could and should go on, and I am exploring a few ways, mainly using socials. For example, [a post on Threads][threads-post] the other day got **more than 50k views**, and I am sure it was responsible for a spike in sales right at the beginning of January. TikTok is next, I already know what to do, I just **x** to execute.
