Very late report this month. I have been **busy in real life**, but I don't want to skip this habit, now that I have been posting every month for the past 16 months.

August has been a good month overall. I progressed in my goal of launching as many products as possible, collecting small wins and adjusting course to keep myself on the entrepreneurship path.

## [Data Internships][datainternships]

The last email I sent reached **more than 1700 subscribers**. With a 24% open rate and 2% click rate I think I am close to be able to monetize it. I have looked around for platforms that offer newsletter monetization through sponsors, but it looks like they start from something around 2k followers.

Another way I could explore, is to migrate part of the audience to a **Telegram channel**. Monetizing a Telegram channel is a bit easier, but I estimate that less than 300 of my subscribers will actually move to the channel. Anyway, it's worth trying and should not take much time to **repurpose** the same content I have in the newsletter.

## [X Topics][xtopics]

I have [re-launched Xtopics][xtopics-launch] this month and started to work actively on the product. As of now, it's a very simple product, a bit more than an MVP:

- focused only on **Threads**
- only does **topic analysis**
- only **lifetime deal**

The launch went better than last time, with over 20 upvotes, 5 new signups and **3 Life Time Deals sold**. I have made a funny [launch video][launch-video], that might have helped too.

For now there is no MRR yet, and I don't really plan to add a monthly plan. I think the product is interesting, the launch has clearly showed that there are people that would pay for it, and in the next month I want to figure out how to **reach as many people as possible** to understand how far this can go. I need to draft a proper **marketing plan**, test 2 or 3 channels, and find out which one works best.

## [Soccrbets][soccrbets]

I kept working on the website in August. I published 2 new **blog posts** and 1 **YouTube video** (plus 3 shorts). The idea is still to write content to drive traffic to my books, but I am still trying to figure out what is the marketing channel that will bring the highest ROI. In the past I had some success with **Reddit**, so I will try to repeat that by posting more often, now that the main European leagues have restarted.

## The cashflow

Time to look at the income for this month.

| Item               | Income/Expense |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Amazon book sales  | + $238.65      |
| Gumroad book sales | + $1           |
| Twitter ads share  | + $33.30       |
| Xtopics            | + $45.00       |
| Appliku            | - $10.00       |
| Hetzner            | - $5.31        |
| Twitter blue       | - $10.68       |
| HuggingFace        | - $2.07        |
| Total              | + $289.89      |

The revenue is still **stagnating** around the $300 mark, and mainly coming from the book sales. First money came from shitposting on X. Now that I have **5M views in the last 3 months**, I am eligible to get paid. It's not much, but it's still a one-week grocery from me and my family (or two light meals out).

I am definitely **not happy** about the situation though. I have stopped freelancing in March, and it's now been **6 months** without any significant revenue, despite having launched 3 products in the meantime. But I am not despairing, and I am happy that I have made progress in many areas, especially in my technical skills on how to code and market a SaaS. Probably I will make money with the product I expect the less.

## Real life

My baby girl was born 1 week ago, and I feel more focused and energized than ever. I think the time pressure and responsibility make me sharper. When I look back, it's been like this all my life. I do my best work and take the best life decision when I need to make money for me and my family.

I hope it will work this time too.
