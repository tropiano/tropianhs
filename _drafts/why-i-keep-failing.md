Not sure if I am gonna publish this. I keep failing at bulding on the side.
And I am trying at least since 2018, maybe even before. Probably next year it will makr 10 years of trying to buld on the side and failing. I am definitely makeing many mistakes. but I cannot elarn from them. This is why I am writing this. To understand what I am doing wrong and correct it.

I started palying with side projects when I was still emplyed in 2016 .I wanted to buld a ftooball model. That effort became a Twitter account and eventually I staretd placing bets adn documenting the results on it. By the end of my first season betting I had the audience and the confidence to build a little SaaS on soccer betting and launched it in Ocotber 2018. I was still learning. The website had a terrible UI and a clucky UX. But it converted and I made myt first dollar on the internet. Selling betting tips with a SaaS. In a terrible market. All of my customers didn't care about the model, they only cared that the bets would land. I never went above $100 MRR with that startup and my only strategy was to post betting tips on Reddit and Twitter, hoping that someone would sbscribe to the Premium service.

I launched AlfaData on PH only 1 year later. I was not confident in the prodict and especially in my skills as a web developer. Coming from a non coding background, I was still learning.

In May 2020 I used my Twitter audinece to publish a book on how to build a soccer betting model. I putnit in pre-oreder. And a lot of people ordered before I even wrote a single line of code. Instead of asking for a momnthly paument, I asked for upfront payment. And my small audience was more than willing to pay me for that.

I made $500 in the first month and at least $100in the next months until today. The book is an evergreen. Might be bringing revenue until I die. Unbelievable.

I eventually lost interest in the SaaS, it was making some money but not more than $100 MRR and I could not find a way to grow it. I sold it for around $1000 in February 2021. I didn't sell the book rights. although people asked. I wrote another 2 books, one in December 2020 and another one in 2023. My 4 books are still bringing me something between $100-400 each month as of today.

Lessons learned

- Do not work on a thing too long if it doesn't have traction.
- Pivoting until you find customers is good.
- Not all products must be SaaS
- Working on fun stuff helps you get things done at first, but without results that is going to fade eventually.

# Resolut it

I keep learning and building small web apps but also I am every day on indihackers.com. In December 2019 I publish a post on the blog, a launch challenge, build a startup in 15 days (before Christmas).

I make a New Year resolution web app. I end up launching on the 28th and many people join the challenge in the process. In retrospective, it was a very though deadline, I am surprised that I made it working only on nights and weekends. And it was a pretty functional webapp. The launch goes well too. I end up 8th product of the day on Product Hunt.

COuld this have been a business? I had no idea what to do next. Also, ti was not a paid app. Only 160 free users. But I could have added a paid plan and see if ti was worth it. In the next weeks I lose motivation, the topic is not one that excites me. After all it;s yet another to do app. I'm also frustrated because I can't build features quick enough. But I am also running Alfa Data that makes a bit of money on the other hand. And I start a new project with friends that sucks up all my time.

Lessons learned

- Don't work on more than 2 products at once
- Don't make momentum fade away
- Talk to customers soon and often

# Trendyt

This was a way to try to build something with friends at the beginning of 2020. I never did anything with cofounders and I thought it would be fun. It wasn't and there are many reasons for that. We enrolled in YC Startup School and tried to build a web app around Reddit topics. It was very painful to build this time and we got too much into the engineering side and not enough into the marketing and sales. In hindsight, we didn't really have a problem to solve, just a technical challenge. We were all remote because of COVID and this went on for almost 5 months. It became clear that after all this time we didn't really have an MVP to show to anyone. And we disagreed on many issues. I left my other two cofounders who continued to work on teh project. it didn't go anywhere

Lessons learned

- Don't look for cofounders among friends
- Build the skills to work solo

# Rentit

At this point it's May 2020 and my job frustrates me. A position opens as Data Science Product Manager. I try to apply and interview, but of course got rejected. This doesn't help with the frustration.

I am very active on X and see peoepl building products left and right so I give it another shot. I got for the super simple idea. A rental site for long term stays in Italy. Covid made everyone remote so I say why not. Many people might want to move to Italy and there are a lot of cheap beautiful places. I go for the simplest approach possible. A landing page, 5 listings picked up from a rental listing website. I wanna just build and validate the idea.

I launch on PH and it flops. It's ok, idea not validated. I built it in a week so it doesn't really matter.
Probably one of the few positive fails of my indie career.

Lessons learned

- Launch and fail fast
- Sometimes a landing page is enough.
