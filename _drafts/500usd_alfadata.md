Back in 2016 I started playing with football data, both to practice my Data Science skills and to understand if I could get some insights on how various teams were performing in the League. I am an FC Internazionale fan and was not satisifed with the opinions of football commentators, they seemed to rely very little on data. I was also fascinated by the rise of football analytics on Twitter, from StatsBomb to the independent writers and analysts that rapidly transitioned from posting articles n their blogs to work to big football clubs.

Four years later I am running a small SAAS product on football analytics and I am writing a book on how to write a betting model using code. I crossed 500 \$ revenue this month and I want to reflect on my steps so far
