Looking for ideas, I almost feel like I have too many. Inspiration comes from everywhere, Twitter, talking to people, reading, watching a Youtube video how to understand which opportunities to focus on?

I need a framework that helps me filter out the bad ideas adn keep the good ones. But to be honest I am gettng much better. I have a big list of cards on my Trello board, full of ideas coming from God knows where, scrolling these ones the last day I almost deleted all of them. Only 3 or 4 survived. I also got new ones, noe the diffcult part id to decide where to focus.

- Competitor intelligence
  - market research for this lead to nowhere. On Reddit people are not that interested. I cannot find any competitor, which is a bad sign.
  - feel like it can be difficult to pull off, collect all data, probably expensive and hard to market
  - with little market according to keyword research
- Data courses
  - already have some authority in the field and a small audience that asks me for it.
  - I can pull it off easily, especially if I talk about soccer. It would take maybe one week of effort for a course of 5 to 6 hours/lessons.
  - I can start from my own audience, there are 120 people roughly there. I could make 10 or 20 sales, for 50€ each. It could make me 1000€ easily. But to push it further I would need to place some ads. But will I enjoy working on it?
- Data science internships
  - comes from some keyword research, it has an interesting traffic and easy to rank for it.
  - could do something around data science internships, collect the ones that I find on Linkedin weekly, build a newsletter and articles on how to prepare for interviews...
  - monetizations will come from a few companies that could be interested in placing their ads on my site
- Stoic Quotes
  - again from keyword research, very interesting traffic
  - I would enjoy a lot building it, it's a DB of quotes from the Stoics, very easy
  - monetization is difficult, but maybe I can build a newsletter, some merch, some affiliate links. In the end I could think of selling it and stop.
- Books on betting
  - one person has shown interest in building a betting model on horse races
  - it could start as a small bet, writing a book similar to the existing ones on another sport. Later I will write more and more and create a little portfolio of small betting books.
