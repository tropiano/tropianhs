In 2021 I want to start reflecting on ym life on a deeper level. I want especially to understand what am I doing in my free time, if what I do is going in the right direction and what should I do differently to make faster and more meaningful progress.

I am keeping a smalll Trello board where I list down all the things that I did in ech month. At the end of each month I will go through them, appreaciate what I did and write a small post like this one.

### Conversations

At the end of last year I set up a resolution to start to be more active on Twitter. I have started commenting on twwets, instead of only liking. I connected with more people, I started converstions in DM. It was one of the best decisions I made. ThHaving a connectin wit people that are like minded and very positive was uplifitng, impoved my mood, made me think and gave me motivation. Seeing people succeeed is one of the things that motivates me most.

One day an interesting tweet from [Copernicus][copernicus] caught my attention. Free accessible satellite data. Sounds wonderful. I started to follow them, started to paly with those satellite data and found out about [Terroir from Space][terroir]. An appreaciation tweet caught their attention adn I met with the founders of this smalstartup. We talked data, validation, product building and wine. We had a great conversation and I am looking forward to knowing how they develop their wonderful product.

Tweeting about data, my life, how I work and how I approach new ideas has become a habit now. I use [Typefully][typefully], it helps me disconnect from the Twitter feed, take a moment for myself, reflect and write down what I think. My tweets are much better now thanks to this tool.

I had many other conversations this month, via Twitter DM, via email and LinkedIn. Thanks to all of you who wrote me and replied to my messages. It is great to get to know people better on the web.

### Alfa Data

It was a good year start for Alfa Data. First of all, I found a sponsor for the website that aligns with my vision. For a small flat monthly fee, I am now hosting an Ad on the main page of the website. It is only for non-Premium users and most importantly it's not an affiliate that makes moeny from other people losses.Good deal.

I listed Alfa Data on MicroAquire. I think the project has a lot of potential, ut I cannot dedicate it much time at the moment. My daily job is cbecoming more demanding and the other side-projects are more interesting to ma aand have more traction. I must say I love MicroAquire. It's very well done, there are a huge numbers of people interested in acquiring small projects like mine. I ahve been contacted by 20 people in less than 2 weeks and had 5 or 6 conversations already. I hughly recommend it and will use in the future if I will need it.
