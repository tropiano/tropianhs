In March this year I sold Alfa Data. It was the end of a 4 year long jourey. I started Alfa Data as a simple Twitter account that posted insights about the top European soccer leagues. I ended up building a SAAS around it and managed to expand it from a simple stats accoutn ot a full betting advisor. All while keeping a full time job in parallel.

### Microacquire

I listed Alfa Data on MicroAquire in January this year. I must say I love MicroAquire. It's very well done, there is a huge numbers of people interested in acquiring small projects like mine. I was contacted by 20 people in less than 2 weeks and had 6 conversations, of which 4 led to offers.

All I did was listing the startup on the webiste, inserting some basic details, like recurring revenue and costs and create a [one page presentation][presentation] summarizing all the information above.

### The conversations

After listing Alfa Data on the portal, I had to wait a couple of days for it to be approved, but once it was approved I received almost a reuest for information every day. I replied to all of them, chatting with the interested buyer directly on the platform. Sometimes they required additional information, sometimes they just wanted to know the revenue and the business model. With many of them I scheduled a follow up call using [calendly][calendly].

I had 6 conversations in total. Sometimes it was a team, sometimes it was a single person. They cuold be developers, or simply investors, with or without experience in the field but all with an interest in soccer, statistics and also betting. The conversations were quite informal, at least I tried to keep them that way. We always went through the website, the revenue streams, the operating costs and the potential additional revenue channels. Those conversations were also a way for me to evaluate what ideas the buyer had to develop QALfa Dtaa as a business. It was important to me that the new owner would somehow have the same vision as me, to make betting more scientific and fun for as many people as possible.

### The offers

I received offers to buy either immediately after or a few days after the call. I kept my options open by replying to the offer but always letting them know that I was having more conversations with potential buyers and by fixing a date when I would have made my decision.

Some offers were a bit low than what I asked for, which is perfectly normal. When someone outbid the previous offer, I alwasy let them know, incase they want to make a better one or match my request. I ended up getting multiple offers that matched what I requested and I decided to accept the one from the team I liked the most. They went to rebrand to [UnderDog Analytica][UnderDog] and created a newsletter for smart betting. 

### The transition
